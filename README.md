 ###Description 
This is the first milestone for the game *RISK*. The rules followed in this game can be found [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_(game))
 The initial 
milestone is a console based implementation of the game. The game takes players 
inputs on actions via the keyboard. In the next milestone, the
group will look at adding a Graphical User Interface, so the players can provide
input via a mouse. The group will need to implement the Model,View, Controller (MVC) 
pattern in order for this to happen. This initial milestone will be the *Model* in the pattern.
In the next milestone, we will also need to implement unit testing to see if the game works properly.
