 ### Description 
This is the second milestone for the game *RISK*. The rules followed in this game can be found [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_(game))
The initial milestone is a console based implementation of the game. The game takes players 
inputs on actions via the keyboard. The group has now changed this to implement a Graphic User Interface (GUI). 
The inputs for the GUI is taken via the mouse by the players selecting territories based on buttons. The number of 
troops and players based on spinners. The text updating each action is based on a text area. The players can also see 
how many players they have in each territory via lists. The GUI implements a MVC model. The group also added
 unit testing for the model. From the previous milestone, the group fixed 
known issues such as the use of magic numbers and updating the README file. In the upcoming milestone, the group will implement an 
AI to play the game. The group will also look at implementing the fortify method after every turn as well.
