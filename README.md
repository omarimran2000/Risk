 ### Description 
This is the third milestone for the game *RISK*. The rules followed in this game can be found [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_(game))
This milestone included adding the implementation of fortify and an AI. The group added deploy at the initial milestone 
so it wasn't required for this one. Fortify is when a player can move troops from one territory to another. It is done 
by pressing pass attack,selecting two territories,number of troops then pressing fortify. The AI is a type of player that does all the required game moves automatically (i.e. fortify,deploy,attack,move).
The group also added a ModelListener to implement MVC better. The testing has also been updated to test fortify.
 In the next milestone, the group will look at creating custom maps. Since our current map is in a JSON, the loading the 
map part is completed. The group will also look at implementing save/load features as well.
